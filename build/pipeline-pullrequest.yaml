    #using a dedicated lab account ("idlabca@msidlab8.com"). This machine is part of the "DevEx Win8 Automation" agent pool.
    #Because this agent pool is shared with other teams in our org, a specific agent has been assigned to this build to avoid collisions
    #and to allow teams to configure the agent as needed for their specific platform.
    #This agent ('MSIDWIN802') is configured to specifically run MSAL.NET PKey Auth tests and should be used primarily.
